# Customer_Experience_Survey

This website was created to be used by my favorite pizza place of all time, Attilio's. Coming from a role as a technical consultant at a customer experience surveying company, I wanted to try my hand at developing an app from scratch that I used to implement at the enterpeise level. Fundamentally, this app is designed to take in data from a user and save it in a database. JAWS_DB was used in conjunction with Heroku deployment as a database. An SQL database was chosen because of the uniformity of survey data.

Industry best practice questions are asked, and branding consistency was taken into consideration. In the future, I am working on getting the d3 package for dynamic reporting on the survey results. A preview is available throught the /admin route.


This app will not work through github as there is no attached databse, but can be found at:
